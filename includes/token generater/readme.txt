This is a tiny little function that simply generates little tokens which could be good for activation keys, ID numbers or what ever, it was litterily something I wrote when I was board. 
string generate_token(int token_length)
This generates a token of numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters. Length represents how long you want the token to be see example.bgt. 
Heh, maybe it'll actually be useful for something. :D
